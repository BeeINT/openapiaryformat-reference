Goals
==============

These goals describe the foundation of what we try to achieve. This will be a guideline to help us to refine upcoming iterations of this document and format. Take also a look at the :ref:`roadmap-reference-label` for the upcoming milestones.

* Everything should be as human readable as possible without compromising machine-readability
* The format can be used in a very lean way (short and simple) but should be powerfull enough to handle all cases.
* The current state of the apiaries and hives is always easy avaialble and does not require computing or looking at history data
